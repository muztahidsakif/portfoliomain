								<p>My name is Muztahid Sakif and I am a senior attending New York City College of Technology, studying Computer Information Systems. Throughout my college journey, I've worked on several projects that enhanced my team working skills, ability to communicate effectively, and most importantly, pique my interest in the various tracks of Information Technology. I have acquired core knowledge in Networking, IT support and cloud computing. I have also acquired work experience in the field of IT, giving me the opportunity to learn from my supervisors and mentors. Working for the Department of Education, I was assigned to different DOE schools where I was solving technical problems and managing other IT services. Working at this role gave me the opportunity to challenge myself as the role of Tech Support can be very demanding with large volume of requests which enhanced my ability to work under pressure. Working in the role of IT support, I've had the opportunity to communicate and build relationships with staff members from different departments, allowing me to enjoy my work experience on a day-to-day basis. Currently, I'm looking to gain even more exposure in the field of Information Technology. I specifically want to acquire experience in Cloud Computing as I see it having meaningful impact to companies and business around the world.   </p>
